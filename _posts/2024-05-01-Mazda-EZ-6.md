# The Mazda EZ-6: A New Era of Electric Vehicles

The Mazda EZ-6, unveiled at the Beijing Auto Show, is a testament to Mazda's commitment to the electric vehicle (EV) market. This modern sport sedan, available as an EV or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), is a game-changer for the brand.

## Size and Design

The Mazda EZ-6 is a rear-wheel-drive sedan that is 4,921 mm long, 1,890 mm wide, and 1,485 mm tall. Its design is a clear evolution of the "Kodo" design language that's so appealing on the brand's other cars. The EZ-6 even features an electric-powered rear spoiler and boasts a 50:50 weight distribution.

Comparatively, the Changan Deepal LS03, shares similar dimensions with a length of 4,820 mm, width of 1,890 mm, and height of 1,480 mm. Both vehicles showcase sleek bodywork and a purposeful stance, indicative of their shared roots in the Changan EPA1 platform.

## Technik

The Mazda EZ-6 is a proper all-electric or plug-in hybrid sedan. However, Mazda hasn't offered any key powertrain details such as electric battery size, horsepower, or zero to 60 mph times. What we do know is that the EV version will have a range of 600 km (372 miles), and the hybrid will do an impressive 1,000 km (621 miles).

On the other hand, the Changan Deepal LS03 comes in three power versions: an extended-range version, a pure electric version, and a hydrogen energy version. The electric version has a single electric motor that makes 218 horsepower and has a range of up to 700 kilometers. The extended-range variant has a naturally aspirated 1.5-litre petrol generator and an electric motor that produce 258 horsepower with a range of up to 1,200 kilometers.

## Some Thoughts

Actually, Mazda 6 has already been removed from Mazda’s own product roadmap. The EZ6 is essentially a Mazda that has been rebranded and redesigned based on the Changan Deepal LS03. There is no concrete information about whether this car will be manufactured in China and then exported for sale worldwide in the future. With the story up to here, it inevitably makes one wonder if VW and Audi will, in the future, redesign and rebrand based on XPeng’s foundation?
