# Adapt KinectV2 to Xbox One S

1. Kinect V2
Kinect V2 was designed and released for 1.Gen Xbox with a special USB 3.0 Type-B Powered interface. To connect the Kinect V2 to all later Xbox consoles an adapter with power supply is needed. Unfortunately the microsoft official adapter is out of stock and no longer available. There are many third party products with varying quality on the market. We can also modify it by ourselves with a USB 3.0 Type-A to USB 3.0 Type-B cable and a 12V Power Supply.

2. USB 3.0 Type-B
The USB 3.0 Type-B Powered interface of Kinect V2 have 2 more pins compared with standard USB 3.0 Type-B.

And there is a special interface on 1.Gen Xbox with 12V power supply, But all later Xbox(es) have only standard usb 3.0.

The USB 3.0 Type-B Powered interface should be modified to a standard USB 3.0 Type-B interface plus an external 12V power supply.

Pin 10 (12V) and Pin 11 (GND) should be connected to an external 12V (at least 2.5A) power supply.
